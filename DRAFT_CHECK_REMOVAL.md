# Draft Check Removal

## Overview

Draft check functionality has been removed from the payment process to simplify the booking flow and avoid the need to manually delete drafts from the database.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Draft Check from Payment Process

**Before:**
```typescript
// 0. Check draft booking for agent_code
const currentAgentCode = selectedAgent?.code || "AGT001";
const draft = await checkDrafts("agent", currentAgentCode);
setDraftData?.(draft);

if (draft?.count > 0) {
  showAlert(`There are ${draft.count} draft bookings for agent ${currentAgentCode}. Please complete or delete drafts before creating a new booking.`, 'warning');
  return;
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Directly proceed to booking creation
const bookingNumber = await generateBookingNumber();
```

### 2. Removed Unused Functions and Imports

- Removed `checkDrafts()` function
- Removed `getCheckDraftsUrl` import
- Removed `draftData` state
- Removed `setDraftData` calls

### 3. Updated Payment Flow

**Payment Process Now:**
1. Validate form data
2. Generate booking number
3. Create booking payload
4. Submit to backend
5. Handle payment (Midtrans/PayPal)
6. Show success modal

**No More:**
- Draft checking
- Draft deletion requirement
- Draft-related error messages

## Benefits

### 1. Simplified Flow
- Users can directly proceed to payment
- No need to manage drafts manually
- Faster booking process

### 2. Reduced Database Operations
- No draft checking API calls
- No draft deletion requirements
- Cleaner database state

### 3. Better User Experience
- No confusing draft-related messages
- Streamlined payment process
- Immediate booking creation

## Technical Details

### Removed Code
```typescript
// Removed function
async function checkDrafts(type: string, code: string) {
  // ... implementation
}

// Removed state
const [draftData, setDraftData] = useState<any>(null);

// Removed import
import { getCheckDraftsUrl } from "@/lib/config";
```

### Updated References
```typescript
// Before
const bookingNumber = draftData?.booking_number || "N/A";

// After
const bookingNumber = successBookingData?.bookingNumber || "N/A";
```

## Backend Considerations

### Database Cleanup
If you want to clean up existing drafts in the database:

1. **Check for existing drafts:**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE status = 'draft';
   ```

2. **Delete drafts (if needed):**
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM bookings WHERE status = 'draft';
   ```

3. **Or mark as completed:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE bookings SET status = 'completed' WHERE status = 'draft';
   ```

### API Endpoints
The following endpoints are no longer needed:
- `GET /api/v1/booking/check-drafts`
- `DELETE /api/v1/booking/drafts/{id}`

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No impact on existing bookings
- New bookings will proceed directly to payment
- No draft management required

### For Developers
- Remove any draft-related UI components
- Update documentation to reflect new flow
- Consider removing draft-related API endpoints

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Direct Payment Flow**
   - Fill form → Click Pay → Payment success
   - No draft check interruption

2. **Validation Still Works**
   - Form validation remains intact
   - Payment validation still active

3. **Error Handling**
   - Payment failures handled properly
   - Network errors handled properly

### Expected Behavior
- Users can complete booking without draft interference
- Payment process is streamlined
- Success modal shows booking details immediately

## Future Considerations

### If Drafts Are Needed Later
If draft functionality is needed in the future:

1. **Re-add draft checking:**
   ```typescript
   const draft = await checkDrafts("agent", currentAgentCode);
   ```

2. **Add draft management UI:**
   - Draft list component
   - Draft deletion functionality
   - Draft completion flow

3. **Update payment flow:**
   - Check drafts before payment
   - Handle draft conflicts
   - Show draft management options

## Conclusion

The removal of draft checking simplifies the booking process significantly. Users can now proceed directly to payment without any draft-related interruptions, making the booking experience more streamlined and user-friendly.
